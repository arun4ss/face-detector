this programme will detect face and create a box around the human face .
this programme is made for study purpose which tells us how the face get detectected in cameras,
and how camera is able to identify the actual human.


This programme required some hardware , libraries , language which are

PYTHON 3.+ .
opencv-python
numpy-python
and any webcam.

if there is webcame attached in system and is accesible then use port number 0 in cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) .
if internal webcam is not available and you wants to use the camera then connect your external camera and identify the port number and put in cap = cv2.VideoCapture() <-- according to it
